## About
[CLOSEST](https://closest.streamlit.app/) is a web app that calculates and displays the closest planet to the Earth, today or on any specified date. Powered by [ephem](https://pypi.org/project/ephem/) and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

This app was inspired by CGP Grey's video [üåç Which Planet is the Closest? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SumDHcnCRuU) (which I usually kindly remember as "Mostest Closest""). 

**Instructions:** 
1. Select a date or select the "Today" box.  
2. Press calculate!  

You also have the option of selecting a smoother background.

<b>Note:</b> The app has been developed to look best on a mobile browser. Nonetheless it works and looks acceptable on desktop!
